### Hello.

I am a student majoring in **computer science** at Peking University, China. I also take a double degree in **pure mathematics**.

My main interests are:

+ Software-hardware codesign
+ Large-scale computer systems
+ Computer architecture & domain-specific hardware
+ Theoretical computer science
+ Cryptography & cybersecurity

I haven't yet had much experience with these areas. I am currently learning about operating systems and computer architecture, and I am trying to get involved in some basic research in computer systems.

I am very much willing to have open discussions with anyone who is also interested in computer systems research or computer science in general. If you are interested, feel free to contact me at *xyxiang at stu dot pku dot edu dot cn*.

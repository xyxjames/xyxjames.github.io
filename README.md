### Hello.

I am a student majoring in **computer science** at Peking University, China. I also take a double degree in **pure mathematics**.

My main interests are:

+ Cryptography
+ Theoretical computer science
+ Computer security
+ Domain-specific compilers & languages
+ Software-hardware codesign
+ Large-scale & embedded computer systems

I haven't yet had much experience in these areas. I am currently learning about theoretical computer science, and I am trying to get involved in some basic research in cryptography.

I am very much willing to have open discussions with anyone who is also interested in computer systems research or computer science in general. If you are interested, feel free to contact me at *xyxiang at stu dot pku dot edu dot cn*.
